                Why showing up every day beats occasional bursts of effort.

            <p>
                We tend to overvalue intense effort. The all-nighter. The marathon workout. The weekend of pure focus.
                These feel productive because they're exhausting. But exhaustion is not progress.
            </p>

            <p>
                Real results come from what you do repeatedly, not occasionally. Consistency beats intensity—every time.
            </p>

            <h2>The illusion of intensity</h2>

            <p>
                Intensity feels impressive. It signals commitment. But it's often a response to inconsistency—a way to
                compensate for days or weeks of inaction.
            </p>

            <p>
                The problem with intensity is that it's unsustainable. You can't run at maximum effort indefinitely.
                Eventually, you crash. And often, the crash is followed by guilt, which makes it even harder to start
                again.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                Intensity is a burst. Consistency is a current. Only one of them moves you forward.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The math of small, daily actions</h2>

            <p>
                Consider two people trying to get in shape:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Person A</strong> works out intensely for 3 hours once a week.</li>
                <li><strong>Person B</strong> works out for 20 minutes every day.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Person A spends 3 hours per week. Person B spends 2 hours and 20 minutes. Yet Person B will almost
                always see better results. Why?
            </p>

            <p>
                Because frequency creates adaptation. The body responds to repeated signals. Short, consistent sessions
                build momentum, reduce recovery time, and form habits that stick.
            </p>

            <h2>Why consistency builds identity</h2>

            <p>
                Every time you show up, you cast a vote for the person you want to become. Consistency isn't just about
                results—it's about identity.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you write every day, you become a writer. When you exercise every day, you become someone who
                exercises. The action defines the identity, not the other way around.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>How to make consistency easier</h2>

            <p>
                Consistency doesn't require discipline in the traditional sense. It requires design. Make the action
                small enough that it's easy to start. Remove barriers. Attach it to something you already do.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Want to read more? Keep a book on your pillow.</li>
                <li>Want to meditate? Do it right after brushing your teeth.</li>
                <li>Want to write? Open the document before you open anything else.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                When the action is tied to a cue and made effortless, it becomes automatic. And automatic beats
                motivated.
            </p>

            <h2>The long game</h2>

            <p>
                Consistency is a long game. It doesn't offer instant gratification. But over months and years, it
                compounds. The person who shows up every day—even imperfectly—will outpace the person who shows up only
                when they feel like it.
            </p>

            <p>
                You don't need to be great today. You just need to be present. Do the work. Then do it again tomorrow.
            </p>
